🧠 SentiBOT: Sentiment-Aware AI Support AgentA modular, adaptive AI agent that detects user emotion in real-time and adjusts its personality accordingly.🚀 Architecture EvolutionThis project evolved through two distinct phases to ensure both speed and accuracy.Phase 1: The MVP (Initial Prototype)Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI).Brain: NLTK VADER (Rule-based sentiment analysis).Logic: Hardcoded if/else responses.Limitation: VADER failed to detect sarcasm or slang context (e.g., input "I am about to party fuck yeaaa" was detected as Negative due to the profanity).Phase 2: The Enterprise Solution (Current Version)Interface: Streamlit Web App (Dark Mode, Gemini-style UI).Brain: RoBERTa Transformers (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest).Improvement: Now understands context. "I am about to party fuck yeaaa" is correctly identified as Positive (0.98).Logic: Ollama (Llama 3).Innovation: Adaptive System Prompts. The system injects a different "personality" into the LLM based on the user's mood (e.g., if User is Angry -> Bot becomes Apologetic & Concise).✨ Key FeaturesReal-Time Sentiment Streaming:The bot doesn't just wait; it types out responses in real-time (Streaming API), providing a fluid user experience similar to ChatGPT.Adaptive AI Personality:User is Happy: Bot becomes cheerful and energetic.User is Angry: Bot becomes empathetic, apologetic, and solution-oriented.User is Neutral: Bot is professional and direct.Persistent Session Memory:Conversations are automatically saved as JSON files in the sessions/ directory.Users can load previous chats from the sidebar history dropdown.Visual Mood Indicator:A minimal sidebar badge updates instantly to reflect the current "Vibe" of the chat (Green/Red/Gray).🛠️ Installation & SetupPrerequisitesPython 3.10+Ollama (for the LLM backend). Download from ollama.com.Step 1: Install Dependenciespip install -r requirements.txt
Note: This installs torch, transformers, streamlit, and scipy.Step 2: Setup Local LLMOpen your terminal/command prompt and run:ollama pull llama3
This downloads the Llama 3 model (approx 4GB) to your machine so the bot works offline.Step 3: Run the Applicationstreamlit run app.py
The app will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:8501.🧩 Technical DetailsFlexible LLM BackendWhile this project currently uses Ollama (Llama 3), the architecture is designed to be LLM-Agnostic.Why Ollama? It was chosen for this demonstration to ensure offline capabilities, zero latency, and privacy (no data leaves the machine).Scalability: In a production environment, bot_logic.py can be easily swapped to use OpenAI API (GPT-4), Google Gemini API, or Anthropic Claude simply by changing the endpoint. The core logic (Adaptive System Prompts) remains the same regardless of the model used.The Sentiment Pipeline (sentiment_engine.py)We utilize the RoBERTa model trained on ~124 million tweets.Input: "This service is sick!"Tokenization: Splits text into sub-words.Inference: Runs through the Transformer network.Output: [0.01, 0.04, 0.95] (Probabilities for Neg, Neu, Pos).Verdict: Positive.Windows Fix applied: A patch for torch.classes.__path__ is included to ensure stability on Windows environments.The Orchestrator (bot_logic.py)Acts as the bridge between the Math (Sentiment) and the Creative (LLM).if sentiment == "Negative":
    system_prompt = "You are empathetic and apologetic..."
else:
    system_prompt = "You are cheerful and helpful..."
